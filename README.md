Total maps
==========

  Total maps are maps that contain a value for every key. This library provides
  various flavors of total maps.
  
  Dense maps store values for all keys. Sparse maps store a default value
  and the values which differ from the default. Sparse maps trade the lack
  of Traversable for a very fast Foldable instance (if the data is really sparse).
  
  Bounded maps require the key type to be enumerable and bounded (have a
  finite number of values) for most of their functionality. Subset maps do not
  require the key to be bounded, instead they are parametized by a finite set of
  valid keys. The key subset is retrieved with help of the excellent
  'reflection' library.
  
  The Data.Total.Array modules provide total map implementations based on vectors.
  It should be usually faster Maps, unless you need to adjust single elements.
  
  Maps in this library provide most of their functions in typeclasses and so
  the modules are designed to be imported unqualified.
