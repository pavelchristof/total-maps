name:                total-maps
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Dense and sparse total maps.
description:
  Total maps are maps that contain a value for every key. Maps in this library
  implement typeclasses form the 'keys' package, as well as Linear and Metric
  from 'linear'.
  .
  Dense maps store values for all keys. Sparse maps store a default value
  and the values which differ from the default.
  .
  Bounded maps require the key type to be bounded (have a finite number of
  values) for most of their functionality. Subset maps do not require the
  key to be bounded, instead they are parametized by a finite set of
  valid keys. The key subset is retrieved with help of the excellent
  'reflection' library.
